# What is this ?
This software was made to help artists train with quick sketch.
With this you can display a random image taken from a folder you (the user) selected with a specified time sequence (by the user), for example :

Show a random image for 30sec then hide it for 30sec and show a new one for 30 sec... And repeat until "stop" is clicked.

You can also create or use "presets" : .txt files containing a time sequence.



# How to install ?
For windows only, you can click on "releases" and download the .zip then extract it into a folder.

# Licence & credits

PS : As I am still a student, you may expect a few bugs.
